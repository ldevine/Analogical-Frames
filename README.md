	De Vine, Lance (2020) Analogical frames by constraint satisfaction. PhD thesis, Queensland University of Technology.

This research develops a new and efficient constraint satisfaction approach to the unsupervised discovery of linguistic analogies. It shows that systems of analogies can be discovered with high confidence in natural language text by a computer program without human input. The discovery of analogies is useful for many applications such as the construction of linguistic resources, natural language processing and the automation of inference and reasoning.

More material will be provided here soon.
